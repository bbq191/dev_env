# Personal dev enviroment configuration

1. This is my MBP [dev env](docs/env_readme.md) suggestion.

2. Add my personal nvim [configuration](nvim/readme.md). And now i using lazyvim instead(lazyvim/README.md)

3. Begine to config [ideavim](ideavim/readme.md) for CLion.

4. Move git config [together](git/readme.md).

5. Add vscode user setting file.

In every editor using almost same keybinding as neovim. But I also suggested use naive nvim in your terminal. It's so nice.
